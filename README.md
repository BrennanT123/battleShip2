## **Battleship**

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate understanding of javascript fundamentals.

This project includes modular code uses the same functions for multiple different applications throughout the project.
One such example is the calculateCollisions function inside src/checkShipPositions.js. This function was originally used to help the user position their ships without overlapping,
however I also used it to position the computer's ships as well as determine if a shot hit or missed. 

I have also written a few basic tests inside src/index.test.js to demonstrate understanding of the importance of testing code.
